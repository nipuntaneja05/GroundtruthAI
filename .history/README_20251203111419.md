📦 AdCreative Studio – Auto-Creative Engine for Marketing Creatives
Generate 4+ high-quality ad creatives automatically using open-source AI models

AdCreative Studio is an AI-powered Auto-Creative Engine that takes a brand’s logo, product image, and creative preferences, then automatically generates a full set of marketing-ready ad creatives with matching captions in seconds.

It uses open-source image generation models (SDXL-Turbo / Stable Diffusion) and LLMs for caption generation, packaged inside a beautiful, intuitive interface.

This project was built for the GroundTruth AI 2025 – Generative AI & Marketing Tech Track (H-003).

🚀 Problem

Brands and marketers spend weeks designing variations of the same ad creative:

Multiple sizes & formats

New backgrounds & color themes

Changing the vibe/style

Matching captions and messaging

Updating campaigns frequently

This manual process wastes time, costs money, and slows down creative iteration.

🎯 Vision

Create an Auto-Creative Engine that can:

Accept a brand logo + product image

Generate multiple high-quality creative variations

Produce matching captions

Export everything as a downloadable ZIP bundle

Reduce weeks of design iteration down to seconds

🧠 How It Works
1. Input

Users provide:

Brand Logo (PNG / JPG / SVG)

Product Image (e.g., coffee cup, shoe, bottle)

Ad Style (Minimal / Bold / Luxury / Playful / Tech / Organic)

Aspect Ratio (1:1, 4:5, 16:9, 9:16)

Tone Guidelines for captions

Number of variations to generate

Optional: Brand name, tagline, color palette

2. Processing

Two AI systems work together:

A. Image Generation Pipeline

Powered by open-source models:

SDXL Turbo (fastest)

OR Stable Diffusion (fallback)

The system constructs a dynamic prompt using user preferences:

“Generate a high-quality ad creative for {brand}. Style: {style}. Use product from the uploaded image. Use colors: {palette}. Aspect ratio: {ratio}.”

The model returns multiple unique creatives, each in high resolution.

B. Caption Generation Pipeline

LLM (GPT-4o mini / GEMINI-2.5-flash) generates matching captions:

Short ad copy

Taglines

CTA suggestions

Emotional/brand-aligned phrases

3. Output

The system produces:

A grid of AI-generated ad creatives

Matching captions under each image

A downloadable ZIP file containing:

All generated images

captions.json (structured captions)

metadata.json (styles, ratios, prompts used)

Perfect for rapid campaign testing, content creation, and marketing team workflows.
